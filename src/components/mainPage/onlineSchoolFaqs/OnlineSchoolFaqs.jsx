              Fully online high schools and online schools for primary students
              are just like regular schools, except students learn from the
              comfort of their own home – or anywhere else in the world. Just
              like in any other school, students in virtual schools study set
              classNamees with a teacher, interact with their classNamemates,
              and undertake exams.

              King’s InterHigh have been designed and optimized for virtual

              Unlike most schools, online school prepares students for

              courses. At an online school for primary, secondary, IGCSE, and A

              complete education with everything you’d expect from a physical
              school and learning full-time online. Students at King’s InterHigh
              have live, timetabled classNamees every weekday, learning and

              While both online learning and homeschooling typically take place
              in a student’s home, they’re not the same thing. When children are
              homeschooled, their parents or guardians serve as their
              instructors, while online school programs are taught by qualified
              teachers. Homeschools also don’t need to follow the national
              curriculum. Schools like King’s InterHigh, however, teach a
              British curriculum with IGCSE and A Level online courses.

              Online learning benefits a diverse mix of pupils in the UK and
              internationally, including young sports stars and actors,
              entrepreneurs, high-achieving students, and pupils who don’t suit
              mainstream schooling for any reason. With learning that revolves
              around the student, every individual can thrive at online school,
              with a global community and safe environment that supports their
              mental health.
