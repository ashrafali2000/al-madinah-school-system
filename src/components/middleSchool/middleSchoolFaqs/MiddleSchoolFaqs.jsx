              Key Stage 3 is the term used to describe the education received by
              students studying the British curriculum between the ages of 11
              and 14. Spanning years 7 to 9, this period lays the groundwork for
              academic and personal growth, setting the stage for subsequent
              academic pursuits, including the preparation for GCSEs and post-16
              education pathways.
            </div>
            <div className="pb-4 text-secondary-500 transition duration-1000">
              At Key Stage 3, all students study the core curriculum of English,
              Maths, Science, Geography and History. This gives students a solid
              foundation of learning, from which they can begin to specialise
              through GCSE options and beyond. For example, a KS3 pupil may
              discover a love for creative media at KS3 and decide that
              creativity and technology is a path they would like to pursue in
              their education and future career. This might lead to them
              choosing subjects which align with that goal at GCSE level.
            </div>
            <div className="pb-4 text-secondary-500 transition duration-1000">
              Studying Key Stage 3 online also covers these same fundamental
              subjects, with students at King’s InterHigh following the same
              curriculum as is taught in traditional schools across the UK.
              Online learning can offer additional benefits on top of the
              fundamentals taught at Key Stage 3 level, such as the flexibility
              to revisit lessons at any time and smaller class sizes.

              The Key Stage 3 curriculum is the program of learning defined by

            <div className="pb-4 text-secondary-500">
              The Key Stage 3 curriculum consists of compulsory national
              curriculum subjects which are supplemented by other subject
              options, such as art and music. Compulsory Key Stage 3 subjects
              include English, maths, science, humanities, and languages. You
              can see the KS3 subjects offered at King’s InterHigh on this page.

              These subjects cover a broad spectrum of academic knowledge,
              whilst encouraging students’ personal development too. Teachers
              encourage students to think outside the box in lessons, so pupils
              begin to develop their analytical and creative thinking skills.

              The Key Stage 3 curriculum also provides the opportunity for both
              independent and collaborative learning, so students can both take
              responsibility for their own learning and work harmoniously with
              others. This means pupils can go into the next stage of their
              education, which is usually GCSEs, feeling confident in their
              academic knowledge and personal skills, for the best possible
              chance at success.

              For students already studying online, continuing their education
              online is a natural choice. Many families with children in a
              traditional school at Key Stage 2 do also choose to move their
              child’s education online at the Key Stage 3 level. Online Key
              Stage 3 is a great next step to make from Key Stage 2, as some
              virtual schools are able to accommodate smaller class sizes.
              King’s InterHigh has an average class size of 20 students in our
              Explore classes, so there is less disruption in lessons and more
              time for each student to interact, ask questions and join in with

              At Key Stage 3, all assessments are conducted internally, with no
              external examinations for students during this phase of education.
              Student progress is regularly monitored through a diverse range of
              assessment methods, including both formative and summative
              assignments. Additionally, Year 9 students undergo periodic
              low-stakes cycle testing to gauge their learning trajectory.

              Previously, students underwent Key Stage 3 SATs at the culmination
              of Year 9; however, these examinations were phased out in 2008.
              Consequently, the administration of exams in Key Stage 3 is
              determined by individual schools, allowing flexibility in
              monitoring students’ academic development.

              can track their child’s progress through various channels,
              including summative grades, direct communication with teachers,

              approach enables us to quickly identify any challenges your child
              may encounter and put in place tailored support to address their
